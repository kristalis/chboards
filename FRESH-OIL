I long to feel Your presence
I long to know Your power
Fill me now
with more of You
I long to see Your glory
I long to know Your ways
So won't You please come and feel this place
 
Cause I need a fresh oil from You
Cover my life with Your dew
Rain down refreshing anew
From above
I need Your presence today
Please come and show me the way
Shower down Your rain upon us
Make me more and more like Jesus
 
Have Your way in me
So that the world may see
You are the potter
I'm just the clay
Mold me and shape me completely
Into what You want me to be
And I'll be changed from glory to glory
