The Lord Thy God in the Midst of Thee (Worship Arrangement):

The Lord thy God in the midst of thee,
He is the mighty God
He will save thee, will 
rejoice over thee with joy
God in the midst of thee
He will rest in his love 
He will joy over thee with singing,

 

Right by my side
You are here oh Lord
Your presence, Lord
That is what I need
Everywhere that I go
In every place that I am
I want to feel the presence of God
Standing right by me
Standing right by me
